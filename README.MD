NLLB-GUI is a graphical interface for nllb-intference. NLLB is a new meta translator based on neural networks.
To get started, go to the link and do the following steps.

When you open the NLLB-GUI, select the nllb-inference translate.sh boot file and the nllb trained model. Then select the language from which to translate and into which to translate, enter your text to translate, and click "Translate".
If you don't notice that there's an nllb-inference log in the translation field, you'll still get the translation.
By the way, this text was translated from my native language into English using nllb.
